        <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
        
            <p>This website was made and written by me, Stephanie Fisher, cynic, creative writer, and Virginia Tech student. This is my first experience writing a website, but I've posted my work online before. I used to not like the idea of the 'VT shaped student', but now that I've had time to reflect on the concept, I realize that the only true issue I have with it is how the V interacts with the entire concept. I believe that the V part of the 'VT shaped student' is superfluous to certain degrees and career paths.</p>
        
        <h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
            
            <p>I'm really interested in creative writing (obviously), but I also hold a place in my heart for coding and creative design, and website building seems to be an intersection between all of these things. Aside from that, I have a wide variety of interests ranging from mythology to quantum theory to zoology, cryptography, and literature. Creative writing is an awesome subject for me because it in of itself is a crossroads of all skills and experiences—for instance; if you have a lot of experience with coding and how computers work, than writing a book about a rogue AI that takes over the world is that much more believable for the details you can specify. This idea lends itself to the T part of the 'VT shaped student', specifically the horizontal component, for having a broad range of interests and experiences can only better your own writing.</p>
            
        <h2 id="essay">The Essay</h2>
            
            <p>I believe that the 'VT shaped student' concept is a step in the right direction, but still doesn’t cover everything that the education system needs to. For some students, a degree might not be the end goal of college, but instead they may strive to learn a variety of things that lie outside of many current curriculums. For instance, a creative writer might want to be a novelist, which is something that doesn’t necessitate a degree, but instead tends to reward a much broader type of knowledge and craftiness in the field of publishing. There are a great many options open to today’s novelist that simply weren’t available twenty, or even ten years ago, and the education system, including the concept of the 'VT shaped student'(1), tends to be too slow to keep up with the changing times.</p>

            <h3>The vertical component of the T-shaped student.</h3>
            
                <p>Depth in your chosen field is always a good idea, no matter what the field is. The more you know, and the more comfortable you are with what you’ve chosen to do for the rest of your life, the better prepared you'll be to take a job and do well in it. How this applies to a creative writer though, lies in knowledge of your language's grammar and the amount of experience you have actually writing. The best way to get better at writing is to simply write. And write, and write. Another incredibly useful skill though, is active reading, and this doesn't just apply to books—movies, videogames, podcasts, all can be used to help an aspiring writer figure out their own style, as well as natural conventions for each genera and how what you write might come off to a lay audience.</p>
            
            <h3>The horizontal component of the T-shaped student.</h3>
            
                <p>The horizontal component of the T is incredibly important for creative writers, possibly more so for us than any other profession. Being good at writing is nice and all, but if you don't have anything to write about, than it's all a rather moot point. In order to have something to write about, you need a good breadth of experience in other fields—most not even remotely related to the core skill of writing. For example, it's hard to write a novel set in the old west without knowing much about the old west. It’s even better to go out to those famous sites and listen to stories told by people who've spent their lifetimes studying it. How this applies to a student, is what extra classes they take. Unfortunately, there are a limited amount of electives a student can take before they start wasting money they could be using to get their required courses for their degree.</p>
            
                <p>It would be nice if the education system would be adapted more to the T shaped student model in this case, as I personally have many classes I would take if it wasn’t unrealistically expensive.</p>
        
            <h3>The V of the VT-shaped student.</h3>
            
                <p>The V part of the 'VT shaped student' talks about getting job experience and getting your foot in the door of the established workforce. While this is a good idea for most careers, for a novelist, this gets a bit complicated, as we don't get hired as much as get published. What this means for the V, is that we need to concentrate on writing usable material and contacting publishers. However, in this day and age, there are a great many more options available to the aspiring novelist. From Kickstarter(2) to online publishing, to blogging and YouTube, there are many paths to success for the crafty creative writer.</p>
            
            <h3>Your plans and goals.</h3>
            
                <p>My plans, for when I graduate from VT, are to have already written a novel, and hopefully been in contact with a publisher. If that falls through, I'm going to Kickstart(2) my writing career with a plan I've already drafted out, involving starting a YouTube channel where I will read excerpts from my works to get people interested in them. I already have a small following on Fanfiction.net(3), and plan to branch out into other Fanfiction arenas, hopefully gathering followers who may be interested in reading my original work (that I can actually charge for). I will be setting up a PayPal(4) account for donations, regardless.</p>
            
                <p>My goals are what any writer's goals are; I want to make a living doing what I love, and I want to change the world by changing perspectives and showing people what might be possible if we can all come together with a single goal.</p>
            
            <h3>Recommendations for your audience.</h3>
            
                <p>The recommendations I have for any aspiring creative writer are to forge your own path, practice writing, focus on getting life experience, and practice writing. And remember, getting a degree or not getting a degree, leaving college is not the end of the road; it's the beginning, and while a degree will certainly help with many job prospects, remember that there are a lot of ways of living in this world, and not all of them are conventional. You just have to be clever about it, do some research, and take some chances.</p>
