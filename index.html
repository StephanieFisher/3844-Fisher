        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        
            <p>This website was made and written by me, Stephanie Fisher, cynic, creative writer, and Virginia Tech student. This is my first experience writing a website, but I’ve posted my work online before. I really do hate the idea of the ‘VT shaped student’, and the fact that our teacher is so focused on this concept has been nothing short of frustrating for me.</p>
        
        <h2>Interests</h2>
            
                <p>I’m really interested in creative writing (obviously), but I also hold a place in my heart for coding and creative design, and website building seems to be an intersection between all of these things. Aside from that, I have a wide variety of interests ranging from mythology to quantum theory to zoology, cryptography, and literature. Now, you’d think that this would make me a proponent of the ‘VT shaped student’. Well, you’d be wrong, and here’s why:</p>
            
        <h2>The Essay</h2>
            
            <p>I believe that the idea of a ‘VT shaped student’ is a load of hippy cowcrud (and if I wasn’t afraid of censorship, you can bet your sweet bippies I’d be using a different word), and a student should be able to forge their own path through college, and life in general. The idea of ‘shaping’ a student into someone else’s idea of ‘perfect’ doesn’t sit right with me, and in fact reminds me of the plot of many a bad sci-fi movie.</p>
            
            <p>That said, the concept as a whole is a good one—generalizing is a good idea when it comes to the world; you never know what skills you’re going to need going into it, and a wider range of them gives you better coverage. My problem lies with forcing this idea onto students—who might want to specialize. I for one came here to learn a trade, not be molded into something else!</p>
            
            <h3>The vertical component of the T-shaped student.</h3>
            
                <p>Depth in your chosen field is always a good idea, no matter what the field is. The more you know, and the more comfortable you are with what you’ve chosen to do for the rest of your life, the better prepared you’ll be to take a job and do well in it.</p>
            
            <h3>The horizontal component of the T-shaped student.</h3>
            
            <p>This is the one I have the most trouble with. While I think a good breadth of surrounding topics is a good idea to have, there are certain classes that are required for certain disciplines I have trouble with. Take computer science for example. I simply don’t understand why one must get a C or better in <em>chemistry</em> of all things in order to get a degree in <em>programming</em>.(1) What if you’re terrible at chemistry, but really good at programming? By the VT shaped student design, you don’t deserve to get a degree. And then there’s calculus. Why are these classes required for every science related degree I’ve come across? Do you really need to know triple integration to program a computer game?</p>
        
            <h3>The V of the VT-shaped student.</h3>
            
                <p>I do believe that getting your foot in the door with job experience is a good idea, no matter your discipline, though, again, forcing students to do this is just bad. What if you have a different career in mind than the ones recommended for you by the system?</p>
            
            <h3>Your plans and goals.</h3>
            
                <p>When I graduate from VT, I plan to have already written a novel, and hopefully been in contact with a publisher. If that falls through, I’m going to Kickstart(2) my writing career with a plan I’ve already drafted out, involving starting a YouTube channel where I will read excerpts from my works to get people interested in them. I already have a small following on Fanfiction.net(3), and plan to branch out into other Fanfiction arenas, hopefully gathering followers who may be interested in reading my original work (that I can actually charge for). I will be setting up a PayPal(4) account for donations, regardless.</p>
            
                <p>My goals are what any writer’s goals are; I want to make a living doing what I love, and I want to change the world by changing perspectives and showing people what might be possible if we can all come together with a single goal.</p>
            
            <h3>Recommendations for your audience.</h3>
            
                <p>Forge your own path, take the classes you think you need, and remember, getting a degree or not getting a degree, leaving college is not the end of the road; it’s the beginning, and while a degree will certainly help with many job prospects, remember that there are a lot of ways of living in this world, and not all of them are conventional. You just have to be clever about it, do some research, and take some chances.</p>
